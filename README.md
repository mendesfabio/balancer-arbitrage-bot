# Balancer Arbitrage Bot

## Todo

- find ideal path;
- hide from front-running bots;
  - transaction with an account and send profits to another;
  - write a smart contract that executes the swap and returns part of the profits to you and part to the front running bot (would be nice because even if we could send the minimum amount of gas frontrunnning bots would have an incentive to pay for the transaction to profit from it.)
